        <p>
            My name is John Morris. I am, at 78, probably the oldest
            student on the course. For more than 30 years of my working
            life, I was employed as a computer programmer involved
            in developing and maintaining what is now sometimes 
            called legacy software. I am, nevertheless, totally new to
            web development. My granchildren know far more than I do on
            the workings of the Internet! So in many respects, I am a 
            complete novice. I am currently employed as a shop worker.
            I an slowly working on my my degree, having failing to finish 
            Univerity when I was younger owin to family commitments.
