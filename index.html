        <p>
            My name is John Morris. I am, at 78, probably the oldest
            student on the course. For more than 30 years of my working
            life, I was employed as a computer programmer involved
            in developing and maintaining what is now sometimes 
            called legacy software. I am, nevertheless, totally new to
            web development. My granchildren know far more than I do on
            the workings of the Internet! So in many respects, I am a 
            complete novice. I am currently employed as a shop worker.
            I an slowly working on my my degree, having failing to finish 
            Univerity when I was younger owin to family commitments.

          <p>I currently live in England. It is one of the 4 coumntries 
            that make up the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Island.
            The capital city is London - a city well known throughout the world.
            The flag of St George is the English emblem. It forns part of the 
            Union Jack, the flag of the United Kingdom, along with the Scottish flag
            of St Andrew (White diagonal cross on a blue background) and the Irish
            flag of St Patrick (red diagonal cross on a white background). At the time 
            of the formation of the Union under King James (famous for the translation
          of the bible) Wales was absorbed into England. Hence the Welsh dragon flag 
            was not involved! The flag of St George is most often seen widely displayed
            on buildings and cars during major international football tournaments.
