                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>There are not many places in Britain that have rivers that 
                        are fast flowing or wide enough to facilitate White Water
                        rafTing. Yet John Morris, his brother Robert and friend, Ken 
                        Cunningham located such a place high in the Welsh Cambian 
                        Mountain range in the head waters of the river Severn, the 
                        longest river in the United Kingdom. The three friends have 
                        gained much expertise in all facets of rafting, working overseas
                        in both the USA and Peru. With the approval of the Welsh 
                        Government, the Welsh Tourist Board and holding all the necessary
                        safety certificates, the friends were able to get financial backing
                        from Lloyds Bank and the Dragon Rafting Company was formed.
